# ToDoApp
A task management app built with Python and Kivy that features both a to-do list and a shopping list. Tasks are dynamically created and stored in two lists: one for currently active tasks and another for tasks scheduled for future dates. Tasks can be set to repeat, automatically generating the next instance based on the selected time interval. All completed tasks and purchased items are stored on a stats screen, which shows their frequency and includes an experience bar to measure progression.
